# Displaying of different color coding formats using analog led.
school arduino project which actually taught me arduino.
i had limited supplies so i made it using little amount of things
so basically theres a potentiometer which you can adjust value for the selected letter of RGB, HSV, HSL CMYK.
left button for selecting element (r|gb,rg|b,rgb|,r|gb)
right button for selecting color modes: (RGB, HSV, HSL CMYK)

### ingredients:
arduino uno
a pinchful of male-male jumper cables
breadboard
10k potentiometer (values between 0, 1023. look i didn't have specifications for the component, components were gifted to me in a box that didn't provide any info of material)
two buttons
3x 330 Ohm resistor 
4x 460 Ohm resistor (button tutorial told me i need a 10k Ohm resistor for each button but i didn't have any. if you build like i did, electronics too close to your breadboard will interfere with your input. it does on mine. anyways, buttons get 920 Ohms each.)
1x RGB LED (anode led, runs in 5v)
